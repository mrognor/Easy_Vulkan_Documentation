To prepare the project for work, you must do the following\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Install a vulkan. You can do it yourself or use a script install vulkan.\+bat from this folder
\item Install glfw and glm. Use the install\+\_\+glfw\+\_\+and\+\_\+glm.\+bat script from this folder
\item Run configure.\+bat to make sln project using cmake
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

If you encounter problems with the vulkan, make sure that your equipment supports the vulkan and update the drivers. ~\newline

If you want to remove or update glfw and glm, you can remove them using a delete\+\_\+glfw\+\_\+and\+\_\+glm.\+bat script To change the version of the volcano being installed, or glfw or glm, you can open .bat files and specify the desired version there

In case of any errors, you can try to run the scripts in the console and see what the error is ~\newline
 If any errors occurred during the download, then the .downloading file remains in the folder, which you can delete

If you want to configure the project for Min\+GW or for a 32 bit system, you can simply use cmake for this

The directories of the included files of all libraries are located in the folder with the Vulkan SDK. Vulkan files are stored in the include folder. Third-\/party library files are stored in the Easy\+Vulkan\+Libs folder. To add them to Visual Studio Code, open the settings, find the C\+\_\+\+Cpp \char`\"{} Default\+: Include Path\char`\"{} item there and add all the paths to the include folders there
